# Clip

### The clean and simple tab organizer.

---

The idea for Clip emerged from a desire to maintain a clean, minimalist appearance in Chrome while having several tabs running. Clip is intended to be a useful tool for storing links to tab windows that I would rather be closed during a session, without the need to add more bookmarks that would need to be deleted later. Think of Clip as a kind of "temporary bookmarks folder" that behaves as a stand-in which only lasts as long as the browser is running.
